# About
Adds scripts to the right-click menu of Nautilus, the default file explorer in most Gnome-based distributions.

# Installation
Place scripts in `~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts`, creating the directory if it does not exist. Run `chmod +x ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/*` if the scripts do not show up in the menu.

To add an icon to the script, right click it and select `Properties`, then click on the icon to select a new one. A variety icons can be found at `/usr/share/pixmaps/`, or you can use your own.
